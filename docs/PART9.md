# Fly the Tello drone with custom Visual Recognition of drone pictures

### Alert - **[Watson Visual Recognition service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/visual-recognition?topic=visual-recognition-index) has been discontinued**
The steps in this section are no longer available.

Now that the Tello is taking pictures and classifying images using the default classifier, in this final challenge the Tello will fly, take pictures, classify images using a custom classifier.

## Task

### Train a Watson Visual Recogition Custom Classifier

Follow the instructions in this [tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/detect-wildfire-damaged-homes-using-drone-images-watson-visual-recognition/) to train a Watson Visual Recognition custom classifier.  You might take drone images of balls in your yard, your dog playing in your yard, leaves in your gutters, bird nests in trees.  Anything your Tello Drone might see.

### Watson Visual Recogition Custom Classifier Model ID

- Train a Watson Visual Recogition Custom Classifier using images of your choice.
- After training has completed, turn to the Project Asset Visual Recognition model **Overview** tab.
- Copy the **Model ID** to your clipboard.

### Configure your Node-RED Flow to fly your Tello while taking pictures and classifying images

- Return to your Node-RED browser window
- Import the [solution flow](/flows/solutions/part9_solution.json)
- Turn on your drone and connect to the drone Wifi
- Manually press the **TELLO_LOW_LEVEL_CONNECT** inject node.
- Turn to the Node-RED Dashboard - Tello Camera Dashboard.
- Paste the Model ID into the dashboard
- Press the button to start taking pictures every 10 seconds.
- Take-Off
- See screenshot:
